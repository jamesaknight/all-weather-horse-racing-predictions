Features,Feature Type,"Need changing, encoding, binning?",Comments
Race Time,Race level,Ignore eventually,Basically irrelevant but we probably need this so that we can produce race level features like Pace Pressure (ie we can identify that individual horse columns ran in/are due to run in the same race)
Course,Race level,Needs encoding,"I think these will need to be one hot encoded (i.e Kempton Yes/No, Lingfield yes/No etc …/)"
Distance (y),Race level,,Distance of the race in yards.
Race Type,Race level,,"Every race we look at is A/W here, so we could maybe ditch this for this version, but Race Type LTO (Last Time Out) will be relevant "
Runners,Race level,,Number of runners in race
Class,Race level,Needs encoding,"This should be converted into A = 1, B = 2 etc as A is closer to B than C "
Going,Race level,Needs encoding,"Again, almost irrelevant in AW model (usually but not always 'Standard' going), but *is* more relevant for 'Going Last Time' - as runners may have run on turf last time and there will be information in that. We will need to encode based on scale =  1 = Heavy, 2 = Soft, 3 = G/S etc"
Pace IV Led,Race level,Needs to be individulized -then becomes a horse level feature 'ie Predicted Pace today IV at Course and Distance',"This tells us how well horses that have 'Led' have done over this Course & Distance - with 1.00 implying they have won their share of races >1 the are winning more than fair share (eg 2.00 = winning twice as many races as you'd expect from teh number of runner), <1 less than fair share etc"
Pace IV Prominent,Race level,Needs to be individulized,AS above - **Do we look to try to allocate Led/Prominent/Held Up to each horse based on previous pace performance and then allocate it a predicted Pace IV from these three options? **
Pace IV Held Up,Race level,Needs to be individulized,
LTO Pace IV Leaders,Horse level,Needs to be individulized,This tells us what the Pace bias was for the individual horse in its previous race. It might highlight where a horse was likely unfavoured by its runstyle
LTO Pace IV Prominent,Horse level,Needs to be individulized,AS above we want to allocate a LTO theoretical Pace IV based on the horses actual pace code last time (ie if it Led we allocate it 'LTO Pace IV Leaders' figures)
LTO Pace IV Held Up,Horse level,Needs to be individulized,
Draw,Race level,Needs encoding,This is important and interacts with Course & Distance. Ie Stall 1 at Kempton will be a big advantage over certain distances. Will need some thought tho re how we encode as draws will tend to perform similarly to neighbouring draws but it isn't a linear relationship
Draw IV,Race level,Not sure,"This gives us the Impact Value of the draw over Course and Distance [*I don’t love this as it's probably too binary in terms of win/loss, would much prefer something like % rivals beaten but not sure I have that data)"
Position,Target,,"This shows us where the horse finished in the race. If we are using WIN/LOSS as our target variable, them 1/not 1 is our target"
Jockey,Horse level,Ignore for now,This is the individual jockey name. I think for now this is probably a nightmare to try to include and we would be better just relying on telling the model broadly how good the jockey is rather than it trying to learn (and likely overfit) based on hunderds of jockeys etc
Trainer,Horse level,Ignore for now,Same comments as for jockeys
Age,Horse level,,Age of horse
Weight (pounds),Horse level,,Weight horses is carrying
DSLR,Horse level,,Days since last run
Equip,Horse level,"Poss ignore for v1, would need encoding - we could look at a v simple 'has equipment changed since last run?'",What equipment is the horse wearing. This is probably quite complicated to deal with - we could maybe consider a very simple flag that indicates if the equipment has changed since the last run or whether equipment is being used for first time ever
Sex Abbrev,Horse level,Needs encoding,"One Hot Encoded as each colt, gelding, mare, filly is distinct "
Pace String,Horse level,"Eventually bin, but use to predict 'Pace today'","This shows how the horse has run on previous starts P = Prominent, H = Held Up, L = Led - we can prob come up with a relatively simple algo to predict which of the three is the most likely for today's race"
BF Decimal SP,Target?,May not use this,"This tells us what the final odds of the horse were in previous races, it will obviously be unknown for forthcoming races, so couldn’t be used for training. In some models, the implied % chance of the horse could be used as a target variable"
"Won (1=Won, 0=Lost)",Target,,We could just use this as our target variable
PRC Average,Horse level,Do we rank these? Do we do 'points off race top rated' for GBDT implementation?,"This rating is an average class indicator for the horse on same race type as today, i.e. turf, aw, chase, hurdle, NHF and is calculated using a class weighting number, the finishing position and no of runners in last race."
PRC Last Run,Horse level,As above,
PRC 2nd Last Run,Horse level,,
PRC 3rd Last Run,Horse level,,
Pace Rating,Horse level,"Feels like they have done the Pace work here and we can allocate 0-2 as 'H' 4-6 = P, >6 = L","I think they have looked at last three runs and score 0 for Held Up, 2 for Prominent and 4 for Led and summed. WE should be able to use this to create a race level 'Pace pressure' metric."
Pace Rating Rank,Horse level,,
OR,Horse level,Probably bin this for v1,"This gives us horse's official rating but can probably ignore in v1. (NB - *Will* be useful for non-handicap races as it tells us how good the horse is (officially, anyway))"
OR Rank,Horse level,AS above,
Trn Stats,Horse level,"Again, think 'Points off top rated in race' might work well","Trainer's statistical rating according to Proform - genuinely not sure how good these are, but in the absence of any other trainer metric, think we go with it"
